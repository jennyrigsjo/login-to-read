Restrict access to selected posts to logged-in users.

== Description ==

Currently WordPress offers no native way to limit post visibility to authenticated (logged-in) users. This plugin enables post authors to do just that.

The plugin adds a 'Log In To Read' metabox to the quick edit panel and editor sidebar that allows authors to check the option 'Require user login' for a given post, thus restricting access to the post's content to logged-in users only.

== Installation & how to use ==

**DISCLAIMER: The plugin is not yet listed in the official WordPress plugin directory. Do not install directly on a production site, always test new plugins on a development site first.**

1. Unzip the folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin in the 'Plugins' list in the WordPress admin area.
3. Find the 'Log In To Read' metabox in the quick edit panel or editor sidebar and check the option 'Require user login'.

== Available admin options ==

* Select the post types for which login requirement should be enabled (default 'post' and 'page').
* Hide/show the 'Login To Read' column in the admin posts list.
